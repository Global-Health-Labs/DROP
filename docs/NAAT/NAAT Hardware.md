Custom hardware is not required for running NAAT assays, as the Hamilton star is already outfitted to run tube and plate based assays. Below we have included CAD files to modify commercially available cooling blocks for 0.5 to 2 mL tubes that are compatible with the Hamilton cooling deck. 

### Heating and cooling block modifications

To enable cooling of a range of tube volumes and dimensions, we generated CAD files to describe how to modify a cooling block to be compatible with the cooling deck containing pins for thermocycler plates. 

**Table 1.** Modifications to heating/cooling blocks to enable alignment on cooling deck.
