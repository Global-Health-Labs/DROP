Custom hardware is not required to run NAAT assays, as the Hamilton STAR system is already equipped to handle both tube- and plate-based workflows. For enhanced flexibility, we’ve included CAD files below that allow for the modification of commercially available cooling blocks to accommodate 0.5–2 mL tubes. These modified blocks are compatible with the Hamilton cooling deck, enabling efficient temperature control without the need for proprietary components.

**Table 1.** Modifications to heating/cooling blocks to enable alignment on cooling deck.
