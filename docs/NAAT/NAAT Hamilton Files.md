:fontawesome-brands-github: [RoboNAAT Hamilton Method and Layout File](RoboNAAT.pkg) 

The Hamilton Method designed by GH Labs was built with the goal of ultimate flexibility when it came to running LFA or NAAT experiment. The Method consists of 10+ Submethods that enable the user to input a worklist where every row is a single command being sent to the robot. These commands can include liquid movement, imaging, and plate movement (iSWAP specific) steps with the option to fix timing and grouping as needed. The LFA and NAAT methods are identical, but their layout files are different. Each implementation of the DROP system may require reconfiguration of the Layout file depending on the system. 

This deck layout was designed for running NAAT and other well based assays. For most NAATs, it is important that filter tips are used to reduce the risk for contamination.

### Plate Locations
The deck layout has been defined with the following labware in their respective positions. To use all of these deck locations, the Hamilton flat plate adapter needs to be added to locations 1-9. For most experiments, these will not be required as the only plates used will be in locations 11-14.

### Plate Information

The deck layout has been defined with specific plates. More information about each plate type is included below. 

| Plate ID    | Description      | # wells       | Example Part #s     |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------- | :-----------: | :---------------------------- |
| flat_96     | Flat 96 well plate. V and U bottom plate can also be used here.| 96 | Greiner Bio-One # 650901, 651901, 655900, or 655901|
| dw_96       | Deep well plate with 96 wells.| 96 | Greiner Bio-One #780261 or Hamilton #â€™s 6471-01 and 235656|
| pcr_96      | PCR plate with 96 wells.| 96 | Hamilton #814302 or Biorad HSP9601|
| pcr_384     | PCR plate with 384 wells.| 384 | Hamilton #814305 or Biorad HSP3801|
| template_96 | PCR plate with 96 wells (for template ONLY)| 96 | Same as pcr_96|

The product information is for examples of plates and reservoirs that have been used previously. If the plate follows SBS plate format it should be functional in this plate layout. 

### Pipette Tips 
The deck layout has been defined with the following pipette tips on the deck.
