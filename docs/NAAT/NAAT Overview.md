Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are another diagnostic chemistry that enables detection of nucleic acids, which includes DNA and RNA. NAAT assays are characterized by their high sensitivity and ability to detect a wide array of pathogens. The most commonly used NAAT chemistry is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which relies on a polymerase and temperature cycling to amplify nucleic acid to a detectable level. PCR has been well characterized, which helps to streamline the assay development process. 

There has been a push in recent years towards isothermal amplification methods as alternatives to PCR, which reduces the need for complex thermocycling equipment. Some isothermal methods include loop mediated amplification (LAMP), strand displacement amplification (SDA), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), among others. These methods use some combination of enzymes to replicate DNA at lower temperatures than PCR. LAMP, for example, relies on a strand displacement polymerase and a combination of primers and probes that allows for the amplification of a target between 60-65&deg;C.

While an PCR is a highly well characterized chemistry, the same cannot be said for many isothermal amplification methods. There are a lot of components that go into the optimization process for these chemistries. This includes, but is not limited to: 

1. Primer/probe sequences 
2. Reagent identity concentration optimization 
3. Additives or inhibitors screening 
4. Reproducibility and repeatability testing 
5. Limit of detection/probit analysis

To address the time and monetary cost involved in NAAT research and development, GH Labs developed a development platform utilizing an automated liquid handling system. This system, termed RoboNAAT, is a subcategory of the DROP platform. RoboNAAT consists of NAAT specific software and protocols to enable large optimization or characterization expriments with limited hands-on time required. Additional information on how to implement and/or modify this system is found in the respective sections for Hardware, Software, Protocols, and Example Efforts.
