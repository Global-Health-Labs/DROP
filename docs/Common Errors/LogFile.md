So, you have had an error. Now what?
<br> <br>
**The LogFile automatically generated by the Hamilton software will become your best friend.**
<br> <br>
The LogFile is a file that is created every single time a worklist is run, whether it is run in simulation or on the instrument. All LogFiles can be found on the robot computer here - C:\Program Files (x86)\HAMILTON\LogFiles. The file name will include the method that was run, and an alphanumeric value that is 32 characters long. An example is - RoboNAAT_Method_v3_10a7f1fb99e04a18936f6eb2fbc7e4c4_Trace. These files open in the Notepad app, which is already installed on both robot computers. 

There are a couple ways to tell if you have the correct log file, one is by looking for the most recent one (you can tell by what the date modified value is) assuming it was the most recent experiment run. Another is by opening the file and looking for the line that says "fileWorklist =". On the right side of the equation, the location and name of the worklist file loaded will be shown. This is another way to confirm you have the correct file.
