The RADA Web Application was designed to improve the user experience with generating worklists. For this web application, the user inputs their experimental details at a higher level, and the software outputs the corresponding worklist file(s) and instructions on how to load the deck with the appropriate reagents. 

There are three different Github repos associated with RADA, the frontend, backend, and deployment. All three are required to deploy the web application. The Deployment Repo contains all necessary information to deploy the RADA web app.
