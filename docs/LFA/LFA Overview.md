## Background

Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) are a popular diagnostic technology that enables more sophisticated protein based chemistries to be run at or near the point of care. With low cost and ease of use, the LFA technology has been used for applications that span across a wide range of targets, including bacteria, viruses, toxins, and more. Even though the use of these tests is fairly straightforward, there can be a significant investment required to create high performance LFAs.

<small>Figure 1. Schematic of a classic LFA, from https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-022-03897-9. The image depicts the materials involved in an LFA, which often includes a sample pad, a conjugate pad, a test membrane onto which a test and control ine are striped, and a wicking pad to drive flow (A). Typical use involves the addition of a sample and/or buffer to the sample pad, which flows downstream to rehydrate the conjugate dried into the conjugate pad (B). Liquid then moves into the test membrane onto which a test and/or control line will appear depending on whether analyte is present in the sample. All remaining liquid and unbound proteins then flow into the wicking pad. </small>

To address the time and monetary cost involved in LFA research and development, GH Labs developed a development platform utilizing an automated liquid handling system. This system, termed RoboLFA, is a subcategory of the DROP platform. RoboLFA consists of LFA specific hardware, software, and protocols to enable large optimization or characterization expriments with limited hands-on time required. The system is described in more detail in a paper by Anderson et al<sup>[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-022-03897-9)</sup>.
