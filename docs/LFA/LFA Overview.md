## Background

Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) are a popular diagnostic technology that enables sophisticated protein based chemistries to be run at or near the point of care. With low cost and ease of use, LFAs have been used for applications that span across a wide range of targets. These targets include bacteria, viruses, toxins, and more. Even though the use of these tests is fairly straightforward, there can be a significant investment required to create high performance LFAs. 

An example of a traditional LFA is shown in Figure 1 below. This is an example of a direct immunoassay, where a capture antibody is immobilized on the test membrane that is specific to the analyte of interest. A control antibody is immobilized on a second line to verify that the test results can be interpreted correctly. Antibodies conjugated to a label, often a gold or latex nanoparticle, are dried into a conjugate pad placed upstream from the test membrane. Before the conjugate pad, a sample pad is placed onto which the sample and/or running buffers are placed when the LFA is run. Downstream from the test membrane is a wicking pad, which helps to drive fluid flow through the test membrane.

<small>Figure 1. Schematic of a classic LFA, from https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-022-03897-9. The image depicts the materials involved in an LFA, which often includes a sample pad, a conjugate pad, a test membrane onto which a test and control ine are striped, and a wicking pad to drive flow (A). Typical use involves the addition of a sample and/or buffer to the sample pad, which flows downstream to rehydrate the conjugate dried into the conjugate pad (B). Liquid then moves into the test membrane onto which a test and/or control line will appear depending on whether analyte is present in the sample. All remaining liquid and unbound proteins then flow into the wicking pad. </small>

While an LFA is designed to be an quick and easy to use diagnostic, there are a lot of components that go into the optimization process. This includes, but is not limited to: 

1. Materials choice and dimensions: sample pad, conjugate pad, test membrane, wicking pad, and backing card
2. Material treatment: blocking, prewetting, etc
3. Assay format: direct, competitive, streptavidin test line with biotinylated capture antibody, etc
4. Molecular recognition element(s): antibody or antibody fragment, aptamer, proteins generated through directed evolution, computational, or rational design
5. Conjugation chemistries
6. Striping, spraying, and drying conditions 
7. Running buffer components 
8. Assay timing 

To address the time and monetary cost involved in LFA research and development, GH Labs developed a development platform utilizing an automated liquid handling system. This system, termed RoboLFA, is a subcategory of the DROP platform. RoboLFA consists of LFA specific hardware, software, and protocols to enable large optimization or characterization expriments with limited hands-on time required. The system is described in detail in a paper by Anderson et al<sup>[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-022-03897-9)</sup>. Additional information on how to implement and/or modify this system is found in the respective sections for Hardware, Software, Protocols, and Example Efforts.
