## :fontawesome-solid-y: **Antibody screening effort**

The most used protocols for the DROP system to date are for large antibody screening efforts in the LFA format. These efforts were completed for SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid, Malaria pLDH, and Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Lipoarabinomannan (TB LAM). A detailed explanation of one of these efforts is included here. More information on additional antibody screening efforts can be found in the following manuscripts. 

The rational behind the need for high-throughput screening of antibodies for LFA is based in binding kinetics. Traditional methods for measuring binding for antibodies/antigens, which include either Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) and Biolayer Inferometry (BLI), measure protein binding at steady state. However, binding in an LFA does not take place under optimal binding conditions. The RoboLFA system  is able to screen antibodies in an LFA format at a high rate, allowing for more precise information regarding optimal antibody pairs for a given LFA. This served particularly useful during the early days of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and enabled very rapid down selection to high performing antibody pairs when very little information on various antibody products existed. 

### Experimental Design 

For this effort, we have 10 antibodies against TB LAM that have been identified to enter the screen. These antibodies are labeled TBL-001 to 010. There is a control pair that is established as the best performing pair for clinical LAM, which is TBL-001 as detector and TBL-002 as capture.

In this screening effort, there was a push to run all antibodies in both the capture and detection formats. This is considered a full factorial design of experiments (DOE). For other types of optimization efforts, such as conjugation chemistry or running buffer optimization, other DOE approaches may be recommended. 

The antigen used in this screening is cultured LAM (BEI). 

The format for the selected LFA consists of a streptavidin test line and a donkey anti-chicken control line striped onto the nitrocellulose membrane. This format was seelcted for this effort as it eliminated the need to manufacture custom LFAs for each antibody pair. Each antibody in the screen will be (1) biotinylated and (2) conjugated to a 400nm latex nanoparticle. Something important to understand is that the stack format can make a big difference on the screening results, an antibody that performs very well as a biotinylated antibody capture may not have the same performance when striped directly onto the test line. Therefore, it is recommended to screen antibodies in the final format for the assay. 

### Reagent Preparation 

For this effort, all antibodies were conjugated to carboxylated latex nanoparticles (Magsphere CAB400NM). The samee antibodies were also biotinylated with 1 molar excess using EZ-Link NHS-PEG12-Biotin (A35389). These antibody conjugates were QCed against the control antibody pair and using Vector QuantTag Biotin Quantification Kit (BDK-2000). 

Test membranes were prepared using a generic LFA format. This included CN95 nitrocellulose (Sartorius) striped with 1mg/mL polySA (Biotez), and 0.5mg/mL Donkey anti-chicken IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). 

### Worklist Preparation and Validation 

To break up the 10x10 grid, there are two different worklists required. The worklists are: 

- [Worklist A](./protocols/5x3_full_worklist.csv): 3 detection antibodies with 5 capture antibodies (15 total combinations)
- [Worklist B](./protocols/15x1_full_worklist.csv): 1 detection antibody with 15 capture antibodies (15 total combinations)

The breakdown of how these worklists will span the 10x10 grid are shown in Figure 1.

<small>Figure 1. Grid to demonstrate how to complete a 10x10 screening effort for a single antigen. Screen requires two worklists, a 3x5 and a 1x15. </small>

For every robot run, a worklist is run covering the antibodies shown in the grid. The maximum number of cassettes for each robot run for this cassette holder limits the number of LFAs run to 96. With this limitation, 3 negatives and 3 positives are run for every antibody pair, including an additional control antibody.  

The steps described in the worklist are as followed:

- Pipette 2uL of biotinylated antibody onto conjugate pad
- Pipette 4uL of latex conjugated antibody onto sample pad
- Wait 15 minutes for conjugates to dry
- Pipette 75uL sample onto sample pad
- Wait 30 minutes for LFAs to run
- Image read window 

### Running the experiment 

To start, all reagent plates were prepared with the reagents detailed in the worklist viewer in the RADA app. This includes antibody conjugates and samples (negative and positive). The cassette holder was filled with the prepared LFAs and loaded onto the deck. Tips were loaded onto the deck corresponding to the number identified in the simulation run. The validated worklist(s) were then run on the Hamilton STAR using the VENUS software.

Once the run has completed, images are automatically loaded into the same folder as the worklist. These images were then analyzed using the GH Labs image analysis software. 

### Results and Conclusions 

In this antibody screening effort, a total 672 LFAs were split across 7 robot runs. This included 100 different antibody pairs screened in addition the control pair included for every run. From this experiment, there were a handful of antibody pairs identified that performed better than the control pair (Figure 2).

LFA data is often presented as either S/N or S-N. Both analyses are informative in different ways for an LFA screening or optimization effort. Where S-N provides information about the magnitude of the dynamic range between a negative and positive, S/N  provides information about the ratio between the negative and positive. Depending on the end goals of the screen, it can be more useful to do one analysis over the other. We have presented S/N for this example experiment as it puts more weight on antibody pairs without non-specific binding in the negative control. 

This is an example of how to use the RoboLFA system to do antibody screening. Every assay comes with it's own differences that may lead to changes in the hardware, software, and protocols. These differences must be considered and the adjustments validated before starting a new LFA effort on the DROP system. 

## :simple-graphql: **Other example efforts**

The range of efforts that the RoboLFA system can be used for are large. Everything from an analytical or clinical evaluation to a large DoE screening running buffer conditions are possible.
