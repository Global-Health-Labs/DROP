## Antibody screening effort 

The most used protocols for the DROP system to date are for large antibody screening efforts in the LFA format. These efforts were completed for SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid, Malaria pLDH, and Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Lipoarabinomannan (TB LAM). A detailed explanation of one of these efforts is included here. More information on additional antibody screening efforts can be found in the following manuscripts. 

### Experimental Design 

For this effort, we have 10 antibodies against TB LAM that have been identified to enter the screen. These antibodies are labeled TBL-001 to 010. There is a control pair that is established as the best performing pair for clinical LAM, which is TBL-001 as detector and TBL-002 as capture. This will be identified by a yellow square in the figures below. 

In this screening effort, there is a push to run all antibodies in both the capture and detection formats. This is considered a full factorial design of experiments (DOE). For other types of optimization efforts, such as conjugation chemistry or running buffer optimization, other DOE approaches may be recommended. 

The format for the selected LFA consists of a streptavidin test line and a donkey anti-chicken control line striped onto the nitrocellulose membrane. Each antibody in the screen will be (1) biotinylated and (2) conjugated to a 400nm latex nanoparticle. 

### Reagent Preparation 

Antibody conjugates 
Nitrocellulose striping 

### Worklist Preparation and Validation 
- Generate experiment worklist file   
- Validate worklist file in simulation mode within the Hamilton software  
- Make modifications to worklist as needed   
- Note plate locations and number of tips used

### 

### Preparing for the experiment***  
- Design, source, and build LFA components  
- Identify and define additional liquid classes or hardware requirements within the Hamilton software, if needed   
- Source appropriate reagents, pipette tips, plates, LFAs, and custom LFA-specific hardware  
  


### Running the experiment 
- Prepare Hamilton STAR instrument deck   
- Spray down deck with cleaning solution  
- Complete Daily Maintenance. Skip, if already completed for the day.   
- Load all required tips onto instrument  
- Load reagents and samples into corresponding plates    
- Place all reagent plates, sample plates, LFAs and associated custom LFA-specific hardware onto Hamilton STAR instrument deck  
- Run worklist(s) on Hamilton STAR using Hamilton software  


### Finalizing experiment
- Verify data has been acquired and saved in appropriate folders  
- Clean up Hamilton STAR instrument deck, reusable custom LFA-specific hardware, and dispose of materials appropriately  
- Analyze data using GH Labs image analysis software  
- Prepare documentation of results and analysis
